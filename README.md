# Ecommerce_Product_Listing_App

This Flutter app fetches product data from an API (DummyJSON), implements infinite scrolling for pagination, and allows users to search and filter products by name, price, and rating and caches product data locally to show offline. The app uses Riverpod 2.0 for state management.
